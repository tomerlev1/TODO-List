# TODO-List
^^ New project that were built with Node.js, Express.js and EJS templating ^^ 

* For this project you'll need to install those packages

* Just go command line and cd into the project directory, then write "npm install" and all the magic will happen by itself 😁.

* In the user side you can open new ToDo tasks and you can mark them when they were finished.
* In addition you can adding at the end of the URL "/work" and get to a new page for work ToDo tasks.

Have fun using my project !!!
