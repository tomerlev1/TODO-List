# TODO-List
^^ New project that were built with Node.js, Express.js and EJS templating ^^ 

* For this project you'll need to install those packages:
- npm i express
- npm i body-parser
- npm i ejs

* As well node_modules directory 😁.

* In the user side you can open new ToDo tasks and you can mark them when they were finished.

Have fun using my project !!!
